#2 Homework for the course in Algorithmic Methods for Data Mining (ADM) at La Sapienza university of Rome

## Short description 
In this group homework we analyzed three data sets provided by kaggle at [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shmalex/instagram-dataset?select=instagram_profiles.csv).
The three data sets report information regarding precisely a multitude of posts on instagram (~42 million), a number of users of the platform (~5 million) and locations tagged in the posts. We made use of python libraries for reading and manipulating the files in csv format, as well as other tools for visualizing the metrics and statistical results studied. Each code is followed by comments regarding any technical choices, and our statistical and/or social conclusions are often reported to explain the reported data.
