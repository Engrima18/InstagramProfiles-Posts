# InstagramProfiles-Posts
### 2-nd Homework for the course in Algorithmic Methods for Data Mining (ADM) at La Sapienza university of Rome

## Short description 
In this group homework we analyzed three data sets provided by kaggle at [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shmalex/instagram-dataset?select=instagram_profiles.csv).
The three data sets report information regarding precisely a multitude of posts on instagram (~42 million), a number of users of the platform (~5 million) and locations tagged in the posts. We made use of python libraries for reading and manipulating the files in csv format, as well as other tools for visualizing the metrics and statistical results studied. Each code is followed by comments regarding any technical choices, and our statistical and/or social conclusions are often reported to explain the reported data.

## Content

>- `functions.py`: a python script that we imported as a module in the jupyter notebook, with the most of the functions we used for the given requests;
>- `main.ipynb` : the jupyter notebook with all the runned functions, the algorithmic solutions, the dataframe display and plots;
>- `Commandline.sh` : a bash script (runned in AWS ec2) that achieves the same results above (retreiveing information about instagram posts) but using the command line tool;
>- `ADMPG10.png` and `ADMPG13.png` : tho tablet notes that summirize our logic scheme regarding certain algorithmic solutions we reported (AQ1 and AQ2)
